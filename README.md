# Vigenere_cipher

The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that was invented by Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century. It is an improvement over the simpler Caesar cipher, which is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The Vigenère cipher provides stronger encryption by using multiple Caesar ciphers based on a keyword.

Implementation of the Vigenère cipher involves the following steps:

1. Key Generation: Choose a keyword, which is a word or phrase that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the message. The keyword should be kept secret between the sender and the recipient.

2. Key Expansion: Repeat the keyword to match the length of the message. If the keyword is shorter than the message, repeat it until it matches the length.

3. Encryption: Assign numbers to each letter of the alphabet (A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on). Take each letter of the message and the corresponding letter of the expanded key, and shift the message letter by the value of the key letter using the Caesar cipher. For example, if the message letter is M and the key letter is C, shift M three positions to the right (C is the third letter of the alphabet). Repeat this process for each letter in the message.

4. Decryption: To decrypt the encrypted message, use the same keyword and key expansion process. Instead of shifting the message letters to the right, shift them to the left by the value of the corresponding key letter.

Here is an example to illustrate the encryption and decryption process using the Vigenère cipher:

Message: HELLO
Keyword: KEY

Key Expansion: KEYKEY
Encrypted Message: RIJVS

To encrypt 'H', shift 'H' by 'K' (H + K = R), to encrypt 'E', shift 'E' by 'E' (E + E = I), and so on.

To decrypt 'R', shift 'R' by 'K' (R - K = H), to decrypt 'I', shift 'I' by 'E' (I - E = E), and so on.

The Vigenère cipher is more secure compared to the Caesar cipher because it introduces variability in the encryption process by using a keyword. However, it can still be susceptible to frequency analysis attacks if the keyword is short or weak.

It's worth noting that modern encryption methods, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), are much more secure and widely used today. The Vigenère cipher is mainly of historical interest and educational value to understand the basics of classical cryptography.
